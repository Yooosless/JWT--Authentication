# JWT--Authentication
A login process based on JWT.


We created each error as a different file so we can use it further, each as in 400,401,500.
We do not need any DB to run this project.
If there is no username or password, it will throw an error.


If the user is created with a token then we will be able to see the lucky number in dashboard.


run npm install to install all the node modules in order to setup.
